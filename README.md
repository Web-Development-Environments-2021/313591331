<b>Morgan Freeman Page! </b>

The website i built for the most inspirational idol i ever watched, Morgan Freeman.

He always plays the good guy, and as others says, he also a good guy in the real life.

The Planet is important to him, he is a very good father, and has the deepest voice i ever heard :smiley:

This is a tiny page i did for the 3rd year course: " Internet Programming Environments ".

It contains : Responsive Navbar, css Dividers and Titles designed by me, Gallery using the great Flexbox, 

embedded: Youtube playlist, Facebook - like, share, post components, QR code.

Includes a table to emphasize the differences between Web1/Web2/Web3, and a use case.

Also include, Well designed 'contact-me' form, which automatically routes you to your default E-Mail system. Write me your thoughts!!

The Web built as simple as i could, without using any JS, Jquery or CSS complicated techniques.
