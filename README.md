<b>Morgan Freeman Page! </b>

The Web is a tiny page i did for the 3rd year course: " Internet Programming Environments ".

It contains : Responsive Navbar, css Dividers and Titles designed by me, Gallery using the great Flexbox, 

embedded: Youtube playlist, Facebook - like, share, post components, QR code.

Includes a table to emphasize the differences between Web1/Web2/Web3, and a use case.

Also include, Well designed 'contact-me' form, which automatically routes you to your default E-Mail system. Write me your thoughts!!

The Web built as simple as i could, without using any JS, Jquery or CSS complicated techniques.

Some Snippets..
